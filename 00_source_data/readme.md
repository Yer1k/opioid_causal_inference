Everyone needs to download data from two sources onto your own drive:

1. Opioid prescriptions (*Page 6 on PDS_ProjectSummary.pdf*): 
    - Read *"Drilling into the DEAâ€™s pain pill database"* via https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/dea-pain-pill-database/
    - Check *data_dictionary.csv* for variables info
    - Download data via: https://d2ty8gaf6rmowa.cloudfront.net/dea-pain-pill-database/bulk/arcos_all_washpost.tsv.gz (6.4G [80G after unzipping], all prescription opioid drug shipments in the United States from 2006 to 2014)

1. Drug overdose mortality (*Page 7 on PDS_ProjectSummary.pdf*):
    - Read related section on page 7
    - Download data via: https://www.dropbox.com/s/kad4dwebr88l3ud/US_VitalStatistics.zip?dl=0 OR check **US_VitalStatistics Folder** (563KB, summary of mortality for drug and non-drug related causes for every US county from 2003-2015)

**According to *PDS_ProjectSummary.pdf (Page 6)*, "we will also likely need at least one other source of data, which you will be required to find on your own."**

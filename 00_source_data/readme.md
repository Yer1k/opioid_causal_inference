Everyone needs to download data from two sources onto your own drive:

1. Opioid prescriptions (*Page 6 on PDS_ProjectSummary.pdf*)*: 
- Read *Drilling into the DEAâ€™s pain pill database* via https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/dea-pain-pill-database/
- Check *data_dictionary.csv* for variables info
- Download data via: https://d2ty8gaf6rmowa.cloudfront.net/dea-pain-pill-database/bulk/arcos_all_washpost.tsv.gz (6.4G)

1. Drug overdose mortality (*Page 7 on PDS_ProjectSummary.pdf*):
- Read related section on page 7
- Download data via: https://www.dropbox.com/s/kad4dwebr88l3ud/US_VitalStatistics.zip?dl=0 (563KB)

**According to *PDS_ProjectSummary.pdf (Page 6)*, "we will also likely need at least one other source of data, which you will be required to find on your own."**
